## What is this?

Translation of the Japanese mod, along with some code tweaking for balance and to better suit recent versions of CDDA. Source: 

## What's in this mod?

- An online store! Accessed by a special implant, you can send packages of raw material to them to gain currency, which you can in turn use to buy their products.
- Cute uniforms! Maids, nuns, school uniforms, underwear, stockings, etc.
- Transforming weapons! High-end weapons that can bring melee fighting on par with the advanced fusion/laser weapons some mods introduce.
- Three new starts! (Maid, nun, schoolgirl)

Nearly all items use the "cute" or "AMTS" prefix to make them easily identifiable from base game or other mods' items.

## Installation:

This mod is includes sound files specific for the Chesthole soundpack. If you want to utilize them, you need to copy the relevant files to said soundpack's folder.

## Store FAQ:
#### How do I use the store?
- You should start with a box. Open it to get an implant kit. Use the implant kit to unlock the store.
- You will now have a [Transmitter] and [Receiver]. The [Transmitter] lets you send raw materials to gain digital currency. The [Receiver] lets you exchange currency for items.

#### How do I get currency?
- Small items like gems can be sent directly via [Transmitter].
- Bulk raw materials, such as scrap metal, wood, or cloth, must be packaged first via the Matter Compressor/Packaging System (obtainable by using the [Transmitter] menu option).
- You can then pack raw materials by crafting the relevant recipe, and using the "Send" option in the Transmitter
- Additionally, you passively gain a very small amount each day, based on rank.
- Please note currency is digital. So even in the event a wallet device is lost or destroyed, the currency will not be lost. It's more just for checking how much currency you have saved. 
- Please note you can only store up to 10000 currency on your account.

#### Ranks // Why are some options locked?
- The store uses a customer "ranking" system, where those who purchase more are rewarded with access to better goods. 
- Some store options require higher store ranks to unlock.
- When you rank up, you receive one or two random store items as a bonus.
- Higher ranks also increase [Transmitter]/[Receiver] charging, and will grant you a small passive currency reward each day. 

#### How do I get more charges for the [Transmitter] and [Receiver] devices?
- You gain additional points each day. Obtaining higher store ranks will allow faster recharging. At the lower ranks you gain only 1-2 points per day, while at the highest ranks you get 3-6 points per day.
